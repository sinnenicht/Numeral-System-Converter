# Numeral-System-Converter
A program that converts a given number from one numeral system to another. Supports radixes 1 to 36 and fractional numbers.

Prerequisites
-------------

This program requires Java to compile and run.

Installation
------------

1. Download this repository and unzip the .zip file in your desired location.
2. Using the command line, navigate to \Numeral-System-Converter-master\src\converter.
3. Compile the program using the command `javac Main.java`.

Usage
-----

After Numeral System Converter has been compiled, it can be run from the command line by navigating to \Numeral-System-Converter-master\src and using the command `java converter.Main`.

Once the program starts, it will wait for three lines of input. The first line should consist of an integer representing the current radix of the number to be converted. The second line should contain the number to be converted, which may consist of any alphanumeric characters available within the given radix. The third line should be another single integer representing the desired radix the number should be converted to.

The program will then print the converted number.
